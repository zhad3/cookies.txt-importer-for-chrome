## Notes
* 2023-08-14 Manifest V3 support is the default. The older Manifest V2 is archived in the branch `manifest_v2`.
* Even though the screenshots are in german, the extension is available in english.
* Feel free to upload this to the Chrome Web Store if you have a developer account, i am not willing to get a credit card for a mere activation.
    * You can find some logos that are in the right format for the web store in the screenshots folder (make sure to remove them from the zip when uploading)
* Cookie icon is created by [Alessandro Rei](https://store.kde.org/p/1002589/)
